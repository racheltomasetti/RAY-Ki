                  freshman year consisted of a series of blackouts. one of the{" "}

                  categorized as a fun night out. my experience of consciousness
                  became a <strong>disjointed one</strong>, alternating
                  intervals of awareness and emptiness, the gaps swelling from
                  hours into days. i desperately wanted to find my place, to fit
                  in, and to make the most of my time in college, often coined
                  as the <em>best years of your life.</em>

                  and i did find my place, and these have become some of my best

                  blackouts, the first a catalyst for the second, shook me to my
                  core. in the first, i came out of the blackout with a man i
                  did not recognize on top of me in a place i had never been
                  before. seven hours of my memory ---{" "}

                  <strong>pushing myself past my limits </strong>until on a
                  Saturday like any other, i took it further than i had before.
                  to the point where my friends had to rush my incoherent self
                  to the hospital. where i threw up in the uber and my limp body
                  had to be loaded onto a stretcher and into the ambulance.
                  where they had to cut the jeans from my body and put me
                  through an MRI to see if i'd caused any permanent damage to my
