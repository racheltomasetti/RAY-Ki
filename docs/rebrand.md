Explorable & discoverable - Easter eggs, hidden paths, intentional discovery

Easter Eggs & Hidden Elements

/garden route - existing three.js garden scene (intact)
/mind route - spinning Ki logo (intact)
These may be embedded within posts or discoverable through exploration
Intentional discovery moments throughout the site

Content Philosophy

Multimedia by nature - Not just text, but visuals, videos, embeds, interactive elements
Authentic & raw - The real journey, not polished perfection
Connected thinking - Posts reference each other, ideas build on ideas
Everything points to Ki - The work is the center, this site is the constellation around it

Technical Approach

Next.js foundation (existing)
MDX for content (write in markdown, render with React components)
Keep existing routes and functionality intact
Build new structure alongside, not replacing
