            i have been trying to figure out what this website is going to be. 
            <br/>i keep restarting and restructuring. 
            <br/>nothing ever feels right.
            <br/> all i want to do is build and capture the process. 
            <br/> to share what i am learning as i am building.
            <br/>
            <br/> but for some reason, i can&apos;t seem to get out of my damn head.
            <br/> but then i had a thought today: 
            <br/> <em>what would life look like if i stopped playing scared and started sharing as if i wanted to be heard?</em>
            <br/>
            <br/> because i am dying to be heard.
            <br/> it took me so long to finally share what i&apos;ve been building.
            <br/> to share ki.
            <br/> but i am still holding back.
            <br/> because i am afraid. 
            <br/> but afraid of what? of being heard? being seen?
            <br/>
            <br/> no more of this. 
            <br/>i&apos;m tired of feeling this way. 
            <br/> decided this will be my ki journal.
            <br/> a stream of consciousness while building ki.
