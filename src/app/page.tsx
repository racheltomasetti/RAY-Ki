'Artificial' from Latin 'artificialis' meaning 'of or belonging to art,' from 'artificium' (craftsmanship, art, skill), from 'artifex' (craftsman, artist). 'Intelligence' from Latin 'intelligentia' meaning `understanding, knowledge,` from 'intelligere' (to understand), literally `to choose between,` from 'inter' (between) + 'legere' (to choose, read).

                        AI is the how—some of the magic that makes ki possible.
                        AI can process vast amounts of your thoughts, find
                        patterns you cannot see, synthesize scattered ideas into
                        coherence, and help you visualize the narrative of your
                        becoming. But AI is only transformative when used as a
                        tool, not as a replacement for your own thinking. In ki,
                        AI augments your living practice by doing what it does
                        best—processing large amounts of various data streams,
                        revealing connections, reflecting patterns, organizing
                        streams of consciousness—while you remain the author of
                        your life. The combination of your mind + AI creates a
                        system where technology serves transformation, where
                        digital processing illuminates the daily work of showing
                        up for yourself. AI makes it possible to bring multiple
                        streams of data together, crafting a living narrative of
                        your journey back to Self.

                        The journal is your daily practice of showing up. It is

                        process emotions, and excavate truth. Through consistent

                        powered by AI, the journal transforms from static pages

                        The NOW is where the transformation happens. Each

                        future that pulls you away from your Self. Showing up
                        daily in the NOW means meeting yourself exactly where

                  definition="A way of being and living characterized by presence, acceptance, compassion, and connection—both with yourself and the world around you. Not merely an emotion, but a practice and orientation toward life."
                  etymology="From Old English 'lufu' meaning `love, affection, friendliness,` from Proto-Germanic '*lubō'. Related to Latin 'libet' (it pleases) and 'lubido' (desire). The capitalization emphasizes LOVE as being unconditional, a philosophy and practice rather than just a feeling."

                      <p>
                        LOVE is the why—the philosophy underlying ki. Making
                        LOVE a way of life means choosing presence over
                        distraction, self-compassion over self-criticism,
                        curiosity over judgment. It is the energy you bring to
                        the daily practice of showing up for yourself. Through
                        living with ki, you learn to approach your thoughts,
                        emotions, and experiences with loving awareness rather
                        than harsh judgment. LOVE becomes the lens through which
                        you see yourself and craft your life. It transforms the
                        tool from a thought capture device into a practice of
                        radical self-acceptance and intentional living.
